GVSU IEEE Website
=================

This repository will be used to host the website for the Grand Valley State
University Branch of the IEEE.

All editing is done in the Markdown file `index.md`. Use of the `generate.sh`
and `generate.bat` scripts is no longer required, as the Markdown is rendered
client-side in the browser.
