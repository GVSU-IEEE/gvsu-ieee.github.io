GVSU IEEE Website
=================

This repository will be used to host the website for the Grand Valley State
University Branch of the IEEE.

All editing is done in the Markdown file `index.md`. After finishing edits,
use the `generate.sh` (or `generate.bat`, if on Windows) script to build the
output html.

Note that you will need to have pandoc installed in order to run the script to
generate the HTML from the Markdown source.
